      This summer, former Adobe Creative Resident and Portland, Oregon native Craig Winslow will bring his <a href="http://lightcapsul.es/">Light Capsules</a> project north of the border to help shine a light on Winnipeg's fading ads.<br/><br/>

      The process draws on archival photos and modern technology to recreate these promotional pieces. Each sign is photographed, stitched in Photoshop, vectorized in Illustrator, animated in After Effects and then projected onto the original wall with MadMapper.
